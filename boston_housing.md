## Synopsis

A regression model was build with the scikit-learn framework of Boston Housing data from the 1970s[1].
Model performace was evaluated and analysed graphically and then automatically with the GridSearchCV
package.  Finally a prediction was made for a house with specific features.

## Statistical Analysis and Data Exploration

Basic statistical analysis and exploration of the data was performed.  The basic shape of
the data:
 * number of houses: 506
 * number of features: 13
 * minimum price: $5,000
 * maximum price: $50,000
 * mean price: $22,530
 * median price: $21,200
 * standard deviation price: $9,190
